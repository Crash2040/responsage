== Description ==

This is a small WordPress theme plugin that allows you to make your images responsive. It detects the user-agent string of the browser (Thanks to Mobile Detect (http://code.google.com/p/php-mobile-detect)) and returns the url of the resized image.

To install, just drag the responsage folder of this theme and functions.php into the theme of your choice.

To use Responsage, call the function ra_attachment_image_src in your template files with the image ID and size to produce the image URL.
